# Comments

- [AVAILABLE THIS PERIOD] "I thought it was how much money I had, or how much I have saved."
- Confusion around what is a fund: "Why do I create them? I thought you have connected with CommBank etc."

- "I don't like the categorise income, makes me feel like..."
- "I have to categorise it do I?"
- "I would [like to] categorise it"
- "It's a good thing that there's a reminder to catgorise [transactions]"

- "I like the interface, blue is really good for wisdom and finance"
- "I'm very interested in this app! It would be very useful for me."

- "You should add + to add more categories in categorise transaction page"

- Login button is not clear enough
- Some places don't have back buttons
- It would be preferred if the funds were vertically displayed
